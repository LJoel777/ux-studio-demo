# Demo Next.js Application

This is a demo code from a project I worked on. It is a Next.js application that uses Tailwind CSS, React hooks, follows the atomic design pattern, and is written in TypeScript. This is a simple calendar component that displays 7 days of the week and the available time slots for each day. The application is responsive and works on mobile devices as well. The application is deployed to Vercel. This demo part is only showing the calendar component, but the entire application is available on the deployed website.

You can visit the deployed demo website here: https://ux-studio-demo.vercel.app

## Overview

This project serves as a demonstration of my skills and the technologies I used to build a web application. It showcases the implementation of a Next.js application with the following key features:

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered React applications.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly styling your applications.

- **React Hooks**: Utilizing React hooks for state management and side effects.

- **Atomic Design Pattern**: Organizing components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages for a scalable and maintainable codebase.

- **TypeScript**: Adding static typing to the JavaScript codebase for improved developer productivity and code quality.
